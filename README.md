# A Simple Linux File System with C

This project implements a Linux-like file system using C. It provides functionalities for creating, managing, and manipulating files and directories. Users can interact with this file system through a command-line interface.

## **About the Project**
The project mimics a hierarchical file system where directories and files are represented as nodes in a tree structure. It supports a wide range of operations, including file creation, deletion, moving files, handling symbolic links, directory traversal, and even compressing and decompressing the entire file system.

### **Features**
- Creation of files and directories.
- Recursive listing of directory contents.
- Move, rename, and delete files and directories.
- Save and load the directory structure.
- Symbolic link creation.
- Directory sorting by name or date.
- Merge directories with conflict resolution.
- Compression and decompression of the directory structure.

## **How to Use**

### **Compilation**
Ensure you have the required development tools and libraries installed (e.g., `gcc` and `zlib`). Then compile the project:

```bash
gcc -o linux_file_system main.c -lz
```

### **Running the Program**
Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./linux_file_system
```

You will enter a command-line interface where you can execute various commands to interact with the file system.

- Commands are case-sensitive.
- Conflicts (e.g., file with the same name) are resolved interactively unless automated handling is implemented.
